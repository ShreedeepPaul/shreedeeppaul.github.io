            Hey!! I’m Shreedeep, a front-end developer <br>
            (for now, I am still learning) <br>
            <br>
            So.. a little about me, I’m 11 years old <br>
            (will be 12 in 2 weeks from when I am writing this) <br>
            and I am currently studying in the Bishops Co-Ed School. <br>
            I was born and brought up in India. <br>
            <br>
            A few of my favorite things to do include watching anime, <br>
            reading books, eating food, writing code, and eating food. <br>
            I also love to play basketball, football, and minecraft. <br>
            As you probably noticed, I am a pretty big foodie, <br>
                with some of my favorite foods being, <br>
            momos, ramen, chocolate(of course) <br>
            and rice with dal(lentils). <br>
            <br>
            I first learned how to code when I was 10 years old. <br>
            I had just started learning HTML and CSS. <br>
            I remember being so fascinated at the time, by  <br>
            how amazing it was. You could make your own website,  <br>
            and upload it to the internet and there it was for everyone to see. <br>
            So I set off to learn the power of the internet. <br>
            <br>
            Also if you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them.  <br>
